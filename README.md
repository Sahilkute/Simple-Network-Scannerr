# Simple-Network-Scannerr
In this Repository i have made a simple automated network scanner with the help of Nmap. User just need to run the script in linux terminal and no need to give commands like Nmap.
In your linux machine Python 3 must be installed.
Before using this script make shure you run : sudo pip3 install python-nmap 
you'r ready to use this script.....
